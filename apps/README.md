## Instructions on setup and running

There are 4 folders in this directory, each for specific part of the system: frontend, backend, chaincode, test-network. 
1) Frontend is written in React.js, nothing specific, like normal frontend app.
2) Backend is written in Express.js, uses some dependencies related to Hyperledger Fabric
3) Chaincode is an analog of smart-contract in Hyperledger Fabric, without chaincode, the network is useless. We wrote chaincode in the language we are most comfortable, JavaScript.
4) Test-network folder contains fabric network setup. This folder is also core of the system, without network our backend and frontend does not work.
